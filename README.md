Hi, I'm Adolfo Daniel Santos 👋  
I build a hands-on Blue Team portfolio focused on SOC fundamentals, detection thinking, and incident response.

My approach prioritizes:
- strong system fundamentals (Linux/Windows internals)
- hands-on labs with reproducible documentation
- log-first thinking (events → signals → detections)
- automation mindset with Python

🔵 Current Focus
- Blue Team / SOC fundamentals
- Linux + Windows internals
- Log analysis and monitoring
- Python scripting for automation and analysis
- SIEM concepts (Wazuh, Elastic)
